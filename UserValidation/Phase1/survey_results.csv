P1,Intermediate,5,2,1,1,2,1,1,4,3,1,4,1,4,2,3,4,3,2,"On the whole I really struggled with the base CAD interface which interferred with my ability to actually complete the tasks. I liked the idea of the second interface where I was given a step by step plan and was given some useful tools, however I found it frustrating when i couldn't easily complete the first step due to the base interface being confusing."
P2,Novice,5,1,1,1,1,1,1,3,1,5,4,1,3,2,5,4,4,3,"The second interface was far superior. It gave instructions with suggestions but also allowed enough flexibility to choose an alternative approach or use different tools. I'm a big fan of the add tools button, which provides additional relevant tools without crowding the interface."
P3,Intermediate,3,2,3,2,2,2,3,1,3,4,3,4,4,4,5,5,4,4,"first one, the focus on the design process rather than the tools is such an important but overlooked part of this industry in my opinion. A cad software should optimize the workflow for the project not for everything in my opinion."

P8,Advanced,2,4,2,2,3,2,3,1,5,5,5,5,4,5,4,4,5,4,"As an expert, I prefer having all tools visible, even if it means a steeper learning curve initially. The AUI was too restrictive for my workflow, but I can see its value for beginners."
P9,Intermediate,4,3,1,1,1,3,2,3,3,4,3,4,5,3,3,5,5,3,"The default UI felt overwhelming at first, but once I found my way around, it offered more flexibility. The adaptive UI was great for quick tasks, but I felt a bit constrained for more complex designs."
P10,Novice,5,1,1,1,1,1,1,4,2,2,5,3,3,2,5,2,5,4,"Strongly preferred the second software, it was so much more helpful and felt easy to learn."
P11,Advanced,3,2,4,3,1,4,3,2,5,5,3,4,4,5,5,5,4,5,"The second interface was less cluttered than the first and had the tools i needed to create my basic shape laid out for me which was good in getting the basic shape. Although, i feel it gave me less freedom to experiment potentially with embellishments and with ways of achieving the same outcome which i feel is whats nice about cad. I found the step by step guidance nice, but it would have been better if the steps progressed automatically in response to the CAD model developments. When i did get stuck with achieving a step, it wasn't too helpful so maybe if it could help debug steps i get wrong that would be good too. I'd be intrigued to try the second mode where it suggests different ways of achieving the same outcome!"

The list of actions on the AI box at the bottom was useful, I personally wouldn't add more detail to tackle the lack of knowledge of some user (never take anything for granted)"
